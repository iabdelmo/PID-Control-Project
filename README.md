Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## PID Controller
The PID cotroller is a widely used technique. It is based on feeding the difference between the measurement and the desired value and from this difference it calculates the control output to revert the system closer to the desired set value. In this project the primary control output of the PID controller is the car steering wheel angle and the measurement is how far the car from the center line of the road.

## P - Proportional Gain
The P-term gives an output proportional to the cross-tracked error (difference between measurement and set point). Using the P-Controller can lead to oscillations around the set point. The output of the P-term is as following `-Kp cte`

## D - Differential Gain
The D-term gives an output that takes into consideration how that the cross-track error is being reduced from the last step so it starts to steer up again reducing the overshooting effect that could happen from the P-term.  The output of the D-term is as following: `-Kd d/dt(cte)`

## I - Integral Gain
The I-term gives an output that sums up the cross-track error over time. This term could be used to eliminate any system bias. For example if the zero steering angle doesn't result in a straight trajectory. This systematic error can only be eliminated if we accumulated the effect of the error over time. The output of the I-term is as following: `-Ki sum(cte)`

## Hyperparameters Tuning

I tuned the hyperparameters manually although I implemented the twiddle algorithm for online tuning. but I found the manual tuning was more effective in this case. when I used twiddle the car deviated until it left the track. I also applied a PID controller to the throttle to reduce the speed when the car is far from the set point but there was an issue when I integrated it due to the uWS but I plan to integrate it as it shall give a very smooth output. I managed to let the car control its steering wheel angle at speed of 50 mph which was a good start.

## Suggested Improvements
- The tuning technique need to be changed to be more reliable for this case
- I could also add an emergency braking if the cross-track error increase too quickly
- The PID output could be smoothed by filtering it but that will reduce the reactivity.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
